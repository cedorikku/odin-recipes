    <h2>Food Description</h2>
    <p>Recipe for popular Japanese-style fried pork. Serve plain with Japanese-style barbeque sauce or serve on top of curry, ramen, udon, and more!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 boneless porkchops, trimmed of excess fat</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>any oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place pork chops on a paper towel to absorb any excess moisture. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg and soy sauce together in a small bowl</li>
        <li>Place flour on a small plate and panko in another. Dredge a pork chop in the flour, pressing it in using your fingertips to cover all crevices along the surface. Turn to evenly coat all sides</li>
        <li>Dip the pork into the egg mixture, coating completely. Transfer immediately to the bowl of panko, pressing in to evenly coat. Repeat process with the second pork chop.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a wide pan or wok on medium-high heat to 175 degress C. Lower a pork chop into the oil. Fry until bottom side is gold, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn; cook until other side turns golden and pork is slightly pink in the center, 2 to 3 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 63 degrees C. Pick up the cutlet and hold it on its side for a few seconds to let the oil drip off. Drain on a paper towel. Repeat with the second pork chop.</li>
    </ol>
