    <h2>A Description</h2>
    <p>Japanese curry is different from Indian or Thai curries. It is more of a brown stew and it can be mild or spicy, depending on your tastes. The curry roux, from no heat to very spicy, can be bought at any international grocery store. It can be served over white rice or with udon noodles. This recipe is very flexible; it can easily be made for more or less people. It can also be frozen (don't put the potatoes in).</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil (add more as needed)</li>
        <li>3/4 pounds beef chuck, cut into 2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>3 onions, quartered</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ketchup</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>water to cover</li>
        <li>4 carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 cube chicken bouillon (Optional)</li>
        <li>3 medium potatoes, cut int 3-inch chunks</li>
        <li>1/2 containers Japanese curry roux, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a 6-quart pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and saute until brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onions and cook until starting to soften, about 3 minutes. Add ketchup and Worcestershire sauce. Stir to coat. Add cayenne pepper. Pour in water to cover mixture by 1 or 2 inches. Add carrots and bouillon.</li>
        <li>Simmer, skimming fat off the surface of the broth as needed, for 30 minutes. Add potatoes. Stir in 1 package of curry roux and let dissolve; add remaining curry as needed to achieve desired thickness. Continue simmering until beef and vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Other Notes:</h3>
    <p>Use any beef stew meat you prefer</p>
    <p>Substitute soy sauce for the Worcestershire if desired.</p>
    <p>Curry roux is found in boxes in the international aisle or an international grocery store. There are many brands with varying heat levels. I like S&B(R) and Vermont Curry. I usually mix the two brands. The more roux you use the thicker the sauce.</p>
    <p>As with most stews, the longer you simmer the better it will taste. This can also be frozen without the potatoes.</p>
